# Independent Europe Scenario, For the Glory edition

## What is this?
[Independent Europe Scenario](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/independent-europe-scenario-screenshots-included.166600/) was a mod for EU2 created by Paradox forum member [Kaigon](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/members/kaigon.8234/). This is a port of the mod to [For the Glory](https://crystalempiregames.com). 

In this fantasy scenario, every European province is an independent country and the rest of the world is empty for colonization. Each country has national cores on all neighboring provinces to encourage wars. Apart from geography, all countries begin with a mostly equal setup. All country leaders and monarchs were randomly generated.

The continent is divided evenly into cultures, and each culture can be united into a kingdom during gameplay via events.

## How do I play it?
1. Download the repository as a zip file (click the dropdown arrow to the right of the big green "Code" button above).
2. Extract the resulting file into your FTG Mods folder (make sure it doesn't put a folder inside the same folder).
3. Rename the folder Independent.
4. Move mod_IES.txt out of Independent into Mods.

Load up FTG, select Independent Europe from the mod dropdown, and enjoy!
