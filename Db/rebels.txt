# FTG 1.3 Rebels

# Tags in this file (other than REB) do not need to be in countries_special.txt also. They are assumed to be "rebels" type.

# type = <type>			Type of rebels. Valid types are peasants, aristocrats, religious, cultural, colonial, nationalist, and pirate. The type determines their AI behavior.
#				- Peasants are the default and can spawn anywhere that their faction is valid.
#				- Aristocrats are similar. Their only differences are their army
#				- Religious rebels will only spawn in a province that does not share a religion with its owner, and will prefer to move to such provinces after winning a siege.
#				- Cultural rebels will only spawn in a province whose culture is not accepted by the owner, and will prefer to move to such provinces.
#				- Colonial rebels will spawn in overseas provinces, and will prefer to move to such provinces (they will not move into countries whose capitals are on the same continent).
#				- Nationalist rebels will attempt to form a new country or defect to an existing one which has cores on the province.
#				- Pirate raiders will only spawn on coastal provinces, and will rarely attempt to move inland.
# morale_base = <value>		Base value for rebel morale.
#				 Valid values are parent (i.e. the owner of the province the rebel army is in), default (i.e. use the standard calculation that any country would use), or a numerical value.
# morale_multiplier = <value>	Multiplier for morale. Default is 1.0.
# tech_base = <value>		Base value for rebel land tech. Valid values are any tech group (will be averaged) or a numerical value.
#				 Each rebel tag has its own tech, unlike morale which is individual to a rebel army.
# tech_bonus = <value>		Additive bonus/penalty for tech. Default is 0.
# min_tech = <value>		Minimum land tech for the rebel tag. Default is 0.
# retreat = yes/no		If yes, defeated rebel armies will be able to retreat. If no, defeated rebel armies will disband. Default is no.
# may_defect = yes/no		If yes, provinces held by this rebel faction will eventually defect to a neighboring country if possible. Default is yes.
# may_declare_independence = yes/no	If yes, this rebel faction will seek to create a new country if allowed to hold provinces long enough.
#					 Nearby provinces held by "may_declare_independence = no" can join the new country, but there must be at least one
#					 province held by a "may_declare_independence = yes" faction to form the country.
# may_overthrow_government = yes/no	If yes, a country's government may fall if its capital is held by this rebel faction.
# army = { }			Army composition percentages. Must be integers summing to 100.
#				 Artillery is subject to the normal artillery multiplier, i.e. 10 artillery is counted as 1000 infantry or cavalry.
#				 There will ALWAYS be enough infantry to besiege a fortress, regardless of these percentages.
# possible = { <trigger> }	If present, this trigger is evaluated like an event trigger on the parent country.
#				 If false, the rebel type is not valid and will not spawn. If not present, it is assumed to be true.
# religion = <value>		If present, this specifies that this rebel faction will only revolt in a province of this religion.
# culture = <value>		Same for culture.
# continent = <value>		Same for continent.
# region = <value>		Same for region.
# area = <value>		Same for area.
# weight = <value>		Influences how often this rebel type will appear. If multiple rebel factions are valid in a province, the game will pick randomly between them using these weights.
#				 E.g. if two factions are valid, one with weight 50 and the other with weight 5, the first has a 50/55 chance of appearing and the second has a 5/55 chance.
# on_province_capture = <id>	When a province is captured by this faction, the event with this id will be fired.
#				 Note that for an event to be fired more than once, it must be marked as persistent = yes.
#				 Note also that this event can be fired for any country in the world, based on its country or province designation.
#				 But if there is no country or province designated, it will be fired for the country who owns the province.
# on_capital_capture = <id>	When a capital province is captured by this faction, the event with this id will be fired.
#				 All the above notes for on_province_capture apply. Note also that the on_province_capture event will NOT be fired
#				 when a capital is captured. To fire the same event for every province including the capital, use both triggers pointing to the same id.
