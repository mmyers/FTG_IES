# MichaelM TODO before IES is ready for FTG 1.3

- Missing gfx for some countries
  + could be remedied in countries.txt to point to any existing (unused) gfx
- Missing/wrong names for cultures
  + could be remedied by search/replace in Scenarios/Nations Base.inc coupled with new cultures in cultures.txt, using Config/text.csv as a guide for what cultures represent what.
  = ok for now - put localization from text.csv into localisation/cultures.csv and set culture graphics in cultures.txt to MIN or MUS as needed
- Missing/wrong religious flags and religion localization
  = used vanilla localisation/religions.csv with minor modifications
- Very slow loading
  + probably Options_knowneurope.inc
    + could use knownprovinces = { europe } to speed loading time, but what provinces outside Europe might be needed?
