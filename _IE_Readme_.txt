	The Independent Europe Scenario (IES) readme:

The game:
- This scenario is seen as quite difficult and is not meant for beginners.
- Don't play on faster speeds during the first part of the game. The chances of CTD (Crash to Desktop) are higher.
- Save often, since the game is more probable to CTD with more active countries... (but it will become more stable when countries disappear).
- CTDs are no longer a major problem but will often occur when exiting the game or loading another game from ingame (I've seen no trouble when loading from the start menu).
- Autosaving each year is recommended during the first part of the game.

Notes: 
- There are two icons, both related to the game, in the Independent-folder.
- The IES uses Alun's Reformation Mod 0.3 beta.
- If you have trouble with something, contact me at the forum by PM (nick: Kaigon) or go to the IES thread: (I'll do my best to help)
